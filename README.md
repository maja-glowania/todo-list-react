# Task List

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to my first React application! This project is a simple To-Do List designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. You can add new items, mark tasks as completed, or permanently delete them from the list.

**Key Features:**

- Quick Control: Easily add, check, and delete tasks.
- Bulk Operations: A button to mark all tasks as completed.
- Filtering: A button to hide all completed tasks.

**Remember:** start with the quickest and easiest tasks to overcome procrastination.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
